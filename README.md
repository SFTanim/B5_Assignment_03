# üìö Library Management System API

This Library Management System provides a RESTful API to manage books and borrowing activities. You can create, view, update, delete, and borrow books, as well as retrieve a summary of borrowed records.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This RESTful API is built by using the following technologies:

- **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)** ‚Äì Fast, unopinionated web framework for Node.js used to handle routing and HTTP requests.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** ‚Äì Superset of JavaScript providing static type checking and enhanced code clarity.
- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)** ‚Äì NoSQL database used for flexible document storage.
- **[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)** ‚Äì ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB that simplifies data modeling and validation.

## üöÄ Live Demo

üîó **Deployed URL**: [https://assignment03library.vercel.app](https://assignment03library.vercel.app)

You can access the hosted API using tools like Postman or directly in your browser (for `GET` routes).



## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SFTanim/B5_Assignment_03.git
cd B5_Assignment_03
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/library
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your actual MongoDB credentials and use explcitly `PORT` and `MONGODB_URI` name to declare.

### 4. Run the Server (in Dev Mode)

```bash
npm run dev
```


### 5. Access the API

Once running, the API will be accessible at:

```
http://localhost:5000/...
```

You can test endpoints like:

- `GET /books`
- `POST /books`
- `POST /borrow`
- etc.
